/*
Darkest night
I'll confront you here
Such a destiny was not desired
In this place
I never wished to see that side of you
And raise different colors for one another
Never notice me
Never call my name with your voice

Let me forget everything
And leave no trace of you
What am I carrying out in this horizen of despair
If it's not you
I can hurt anyone
In the name of justice
Your shadow gets in the way of my light
And Testify

Let me forget everything
Still moonlight shines on us
Broken heart
I don't want you to find and have a look at
So I'll sin more
And destroy my thoughts
Make a mess of my hand
I swear on the darkest night
I'll end it all
And Testify

All that I'm left
With is your reminiscences
Take me to where you are
Won't you
Till then I'll keep struggling
Curse of justice you don't know
